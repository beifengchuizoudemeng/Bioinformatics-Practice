Aurora B kinase has emerged as a key regulator of mitosis and deregulation of
Aurora B activity is closely related to the development and progression of human 
cancers. In the present study, we found that Aurora B is overexpressed in human
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), high levels of Aurora B protein were
associated with a worse overall survival rate in ESCC patients. Depleting of
Aurora B blunted the malignant phenotypes in ESCC cells. Importantly, we
demonstrated that a natural compound, deguelin, has a profound anti-tumor effect 
on ESCC via inhibiting Aurora B activity. Deguelin potently inhibited in vitro
Aurora B kinase activity. The in silico docking study further indicated that
deguelin was docked into the ATP-binding pocket of Aurora B. Inhibition of Aurora
B activity attenuated growth of ESCC cells, resulted in G2/M cell cycle arrest,
polyploidy cells formation, and apoptosis induction. Knocking down of Aurora B
decreased the sensitivity of ESCC cells to deguelin. The in vivo results showed
that deguelin blocked the phosphorylation of histone H3 and inhibited the growth 
of ESCC tumor xenografts. Overall, we identified deguelin as an effective Aurora 
B inhibitor, which deserves further studies in other animal models and ESCC
treatment.

Human chromosomes are captured along microtubule walls (lateral attachment) and
then tethered to microtubule-ends (end-on attachment) through a multi-step end-on
conversion process. Upstream regulators that orchestrate this remarkable change
in the plane of kinetochore-microtubule attachment in human cells are not known. 
By tracking kinetochore movements and using kinetochore markers specific to
attachment status, we reveal a spatially defined role for Aurora-B kinase in
retarding the end-on conversion process. To understand how Aurora-B activity is
counteracted, we compare the roles of two outer-kinetochore bound phosphatases
and find that BubR1-associated PP2A, unlike KNL1-associated PP1, plays a
significant role in end-on conversion. Finally, we uncover a novel role for
Aurora-B regulated Astrin-SKAP complex in ensuring the correct plane of
kinetochore-microtubule attachment. Thus, we identify Aurora-B as a key upstream 
regulator of end-on conversion in human cells and establish a late role for
Astrin-SKAP complex in the end-on conversion process.Human chromosomes are
captured along microtubule walls and then tethered to microtubule-ends through a 
multi-step end-on conversion process. Here the authors show that Aurora-B
regulates end-on conversion in human cells and establish a late role for
Astrin-SKAP complex in the end-on conversion process.

BACKGROUND: Taxanes are mitotic poisons widely used in the treatment of non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), however, little is known about potential molecular
modulators of response to these compounds. Aurora B (AURKB) is a critical
regulator of the mitotic spindle assembly, previously shown overexpressed in
NSCLC. Here we investigated the hypothesis that AURKB expression modulates the
efficacy of taxanes in NSCLC cells.
METHODS: AURKB mRNA expression was determined by qPCR in 132 frozen NSCLC tissues
and nine NSCLC cell lines. Aurora B expression was knocked down in cell lines
using multiple shRNA constructs. Barasertib was used to specifically inhibit
AURKB activity, determined by the level of H3S10 phosphorylation.
RESULTS: Frequent AURKB mRNA upregulation was observed in NSCLC tissues
(P<0.0001), being more prominent in squamous carcinomas (P<0.0001). Aurora B
expression in cell lines strongly correlated with sensitivity to both docetaxel
(P=0.004) and paclitaxel (P=0.007). Aurora B knockdown derivatives consistently
showed a dose-dependent association between low-AURKB expression and resistance
to paclitaxel. Specific chemical inhibition of Aurora B activity also
demonstrated a strong dose-dependent efficiency in triggering paclitaxel
resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: Aurora B activity is an important modulator of taxane response in
NSCLC cells. This may lead to further insights into taxane sensitivity of NSCLC
tumours.

The 'NoCut', or Aurora B abscission checkpoint can be activated if DNA is
retained in the cleavage furrow after completion of anaphase. Checkpoint failure 
leads to incomplete abscission and a binucleate outcome. These phenotypes are
also observed after loss of PKCɛ in transformed cell models. Here we show that
PKCɛ directly modulates the Aurora B-dependent abscission checkpoint by
phosphorylating Aurora B at S227. This phosphorylation invokes a switch in Aurora
B specificity, with increased phosphorylation of a subset of target substrates,
including the CPC subunit Borealin. This switch is essential for abscission
checkpoint exit. Preventing the phosphorylation of Borealin leads to abscission
failure, as does expression of a non-phosphorylatable Aurora B S227A mutant.
Further, depletion of the ESCRT-III component and Aurora B substrate CHMP4C
enables abscission, bypassing the PKCɛ-Aurora B exit pathway. Thus, we
demonstrate that PKCɛ signals through Aurora B to exit the abscission checkpoint 
and complete cell division.

Clks 1, 2 and 4 prevent chromatin breakage by regulating the Aurora B-dependent
abscission checkpoint.

When chromatin is trapped at the intercellular bridge, cells delay completion of 
cytokinesis (abscission) to prevent chromosome breakage. Here we show that
inhibition of Cdc-like kinases (Clks) 1, 2 or 4 accelerates midbody resolution in
normally segregating cells and correlates with premature abscission, chromatin
breakage and generation of DNA damage in cytokinesis with trapped chromatin.
Clk1, Clk2 and Clk4 localize to the midbody in an interdependent manner,
associate with Aurora B kinase and are required for Aurora B-serine 331 (S331)
phosphorylation and complete Aurora B activation in late cytokinesis.
Phosphorylated Aurora B-S331 localizes to the midbody centre and is required for 
phosphorylation and optimal localization of the abscission protein Chmp4c. In
addition, expression of phosphomimetic mutants Aurora B-S331E or Chmp4c-S210D
delays midbody disassembly and prevents chromatin breakage in Clk-deficient
cells. We propose that Clks 1, 2 and 4 impose the abscission checkpoint by
phosphorylating Aurora B-S331 at the midbody.
